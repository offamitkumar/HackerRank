// possible cases are that 
// black ball from 1 and red ball from other two : 3/7 * 5/9 * 1/2
// black ball from 2 and red ball from other two : 4/9 * 4/7 * 1/2
// black ball from 3 and red ball from other two : 1/2 * 5/9 * 4/7

// -> 15/126 + 16/126 + 20/126 
// -> 51 / 126 

// gcd will be 3 so dividing both num & deno by 3 we get
// -> 17/42 
// So option C is correct
